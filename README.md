A cute little toolset I made for 210. At the moment it has an emulator and a base converter

I try to put everything on the website. Press (`command` or `control`) + `shift` + `R` on website to force reload for latest app version, if you want an offline app go to the actions tab, click on the ci button on the side then scoll to the bottom to download app for your computer.

A version of the website that is always up to date as long as the code compiles can be found [here](https://jackcrumpleys.github.io/textbook210_emulator/).
