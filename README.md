A cute little toolset I made for 210. At the moment it has an emulator and a base converter

I try to put everything on the website. Press (`command` or `control`) + `shift` + `R` on website to force reload for latest app version.

A version of the website that is always up to date as long as the code compiles can be found [here](https://jackcrumpleys.github.io/textbook210_emulator/).

## download app for offline use [here](https://github.com/JackCrumpLeys/textbook210_emulator/releases/tag/main)
